## Installation and setup

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/WBiome/SY40_Project.git
cd SY40_Project/
```

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and set up:
- build-essential 
- libc6-dev

Execute the following line to automatically install those two libraries: 
```bash
bash setup.sh
```

## Running the project

Open at least 3 terminals.

Execute `./server` in one of them and `./client` in the two others.
You will now be able to follow the instruction in the clients terminals to use the program.

You can do that with more than 2 clients, but they are always linked one by one so you need an even number of clients.
